                <h3>Integration of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence creates machine systems that mimic human intelligence when performing activities such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making.  (al, 2023) <br><br>
                    AI uses a system of machine learning and deep learning to identify patterns and make deductive reasoning from collated data such as images, text, and audio. <br><br>  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Generative AI is thus an algorithm capable of ‘learning’ or producing new content from the collated data.  ChatGPT uses this technology through its language model and has rapidly garnered mass interest from the public.  
                    GAI can gather vast amounts of data points to give a predictive response more accurately, which according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made their company’s standpoint clear that Generative AI is the future of data mining.

                <h3>The Role of AI Integration</h3>
                <p>
                    Information systems provide a specific function within the operation of a business, such as transaction processing, information management, decision-making resource management, and executive information management. AI has revolutionized the Information System world, by transforming every industry in which it is applied.  (Mitchell, 2023) <br><br>
                    AI has heavily impacted Information Technology by automating those actions which are repetitive, or which require little to no human interactions.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI has most effectively assisted the goal of organizations to achieve a more competitive advantage in business through improved information system activities in the areas of: - 
                </p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li class="infobullet">Data Analytics</li>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="subinfobullet">It has improved trend forecasting as it can analyse vast amounts of data quickly, thus reducing business decision-making timescales and leading to improved use of profit-making opportunities.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="infobullet">Cybersecurity</li>
                    <li>

                            <li class="subinfobullet">Cyber threats can be effectively dealt with through AI-enhanced systems that constantly monitor an organization’s online data and protect it from ever increasingly nefarious threats.  </li>
                            <li class="subinfobullet">AI can ensure that updates are done to cyber software as soon as new versions or releases are made available.  This can be a great selling point for customer ‘peace-of-mind’ which may be a deciding factor in business deals.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li  class="infobullet">Chatbots</li>

                            <li class="subinfobullet">Processes that are repetitive or that can be streamlined through automation can be managed by AI software.  Tasks can be performed much faster than by a human and with greater accuracy and uniformity through RPA.</li>
                            <li class="subinfobullet">Tasks that would benefit from RPA, include data extraction, data analysis, data entry, generation of reports, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A staggering 270% increase in deployment by companies of AI technology in their business processes has been recorded over the past 4 years with an estimated 95% integration worldwide expected by 2025. (Biswal, 2023)
                </p>
                <h4>The most common applications of AI are:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li class="infobullet">Virtual Assistants such as Alexa or Siri</li>
                    <li class="infobullet">Fraud detection (Chainanalysis) and Cybersecurity (TitanSecure) </li>
                    <li class="infobullet">Self-driving Vehicles (Tesla / SpaceX)</li>
                    <li class="infobullet">Customer Service Interactions (Lyro)</li>
                    <li class="infobullet">Image Recognition (CNN – convolutional neural networks)</li>
                    <li class="infobullet">Healthcare Diagnostics (Merative – IBM)</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Future Trends of AI Integration in Information Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    AI is slated to improve operational optimization by 96%, which will lead to impressive financial benefits.  These improvements will take place in areas such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="infobullet">Automation (83%)</li>
                    <li class="infobullet">Prediction/ Forecasting (70%)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Improvements will be implemented through streamlining processes thus increasing productivity and proactively managing the downtime of machinery.  Once consumers are encouraged to accept AI interactions in every business sector of an organization, this trend of improvements will be expedited. <br><br>
                    Currently, in South Africa, the fear of job losses due to AI implementation is exceedingly high.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The existing unemployment rate of 32.6% is already perceived as an insurmountable hurdle to active employment opportunities, not to mention adding the possibility (however unfounded) of losing more jobs to AI automation.  Consumers also resist automated or self-help systems in customer service, often preferring to speak to a real person rather than follow automated prompts.<br><br>  
                    As a result, consumers and staff may resist AI since it is an unknown factor, something that always causes people to react negatively at first.  To counteract this, education and slow integration methods need to be deployed to stave off mass panic. (L, 2023).

                <p>
                    This gradual acceptance can be encouraged through Change management, which is a step-by-step approach to transition an organization's focus, goals, processes, or technology to affect, control, or aid change to improve an organization's profits or reputation. (George Lawton, 2023)

                <h3>Current and Future Pitfalls of AI Integration in Information Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    There are several risks and limitations associated with using AI-integrated information systems.  These risks can be minimized but need to be noted to ensure that risks are managed.

                <p class="marginfix">
                    Many countries (including South Africa) do not have adequate or even any regulations or policies in place governing the use of AI in integrated information systems. Companies should ensure that policies are drawn up that encompass any regulations and laws of the country.<br><br>  
                    This would include aspects such as data protection, industry-specific regulations, and best practice standards relating to AI and machine learning. Should this not occur, the company that uses AI may be liable for claims against it for loss, damage or other negative events directly related to its use.<br><br>  
                    Rules should be specific regarding data ownership and NDAs for sensitive or restricted information.<br><br>  
                    These should contain an outline of allowable vendor and third-party interactions to protect against data breaches.

                    The Dunning Kruger effect is a mental bias whereby some people assume they are experts in a field where their abilities are realistically limited.  This causes them to not explore their fields further to stretch the boundaries of the technology within.  It is vital that business is provided with reliable and accurate data to better understand their markets and make informed business transactions. Relying solely on AI to gather this information because an organization lacks the intellectual property (limited mental resources) to do so, would be detrimental.

                            <li class="subinfobullet">Since AI is a new technology, very few trained individuals have the skills, experience, and training to operate the various AI solutions.  This skills shortage means that AI integration is slow or may be incorrectly implemented resulting in resistance or lack of acceptance to the use thereof. </li>

                            <li class="subinfobullet">When businesses don’t have the available skills and resources may result in companies having to outsource AI data mining.  This can become a costly expense which could be easily avoided through upgraded training for existing staff and recruitment / headhunting drives to draw in more qualified staff. </li>
                            <li class="subinfobullet">Smart Technology can be expensive due to its intricate nature and extensive development investment.  This cost can make the implementation and repair or maintenance of technology systems an extreme expenditure for organizations.    </li>

                            <li class="subinfobullet">When upgrading software, or enabling an AI system that is continuously growing, poses the risk that older data (history of transactions, etc.) may no longer be accessible and this needs to be addressed to assure the client of continued service and a maintenance of prior records and transactions.  Downtime for systems needs to be minimized as an organization requires up-to-date access to data to make necessary business transactions.  </li>

                <h3>Ethical Concerns with AI</h3>
                <p>
                    Experts agree that technologists, ethicists, and policymakers need to address several ethical concerns with regard to artificial intelligence, for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li  class="infobullet2">Algorithmic or Societal Bias and Discrimination in gathered data</li>
                    <li><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="subinfobullet">AI gathers data regardless of intrinsic human bias and thus some included data points may skew analysis.  Embedded societal biases may become ingrained in AI algorithms thus perpetuating the bias unintentionally, leading to unfair or discriminating results, for example when assessing new hires, approving loans, meting out criminal justice, or even allocation of business resources. </li>
                            <li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li class="subsubinfobullet">Example: Job applicants may be screened unfairly based on gender or racial bias as AI may use historical data to form a bases of comparison.  History may not be as open and tolerant as it is now, which may lead to discrimination based on antiquated rules (i.e., Apartheid was abolished but if AI uses historical hiring methods, the error of including this as a factor, may mean a person could be discriminated against.)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li class="subinfobullet">AI may seem a mystery as it is a new technology, the boundaries of which are still being explored.  This means that there is still a lot of uncertainty about how AI works and how it derives courses of action or makes decisions.  This is known as a “black box” system.  For some industries like healthcare, it is vital to understand how decisions on diagnosis are derived or decisions regarding a course of treatment are arrived at.  Since AI is being implemented in this field, it is crucial to document how these decisions are being made and who will be held liable or responsible should the decision lead to a problem.  </li>
                            <li class="subinfobullet">As AI technology is still in its infancy, errors can occur and thus determining accountability and responsibility for corrective action needs to be established in advance of implementation.</li>
                            <li>
                                <ul>

                            <li class="marginfix">There are several questions being raised in the creative industry fields whereby AI is being integrated into the creative process.  Questions such as:</li>
                            <li>
                                <ul>

                                    <li class="subinfobullet">Who owns the artwork created by AI alone?</li>
                                    <li class="subinfobullet">Who can sell or purchase (who gets paid) in the event of a fully AI generated creation?</li>
                                    <li class="subinfobullet">AI draws on pattern recognition and if it uses pieces of other artwork in its creation, is this considered plagiarism/copyright infringement? </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li class="subsubinfobullet">These questions and more will need to be examined and a suitable answer will need to be agreed to before industry wide acceptance will take place.</li>
