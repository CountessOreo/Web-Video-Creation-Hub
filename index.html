In the fast-paced and technologically driven business environment that we live in today, it is absolutely crucial to have effective management of information systems as it provides a competitive edge, and strategic advantage. Most businesses that tackle the opportunity and utilize the power of information systems gain that competitive edge in various necessities such as innovation, decision making, efficiency, and more.   
 
In the scope this INF181 Project we explore vital areas such as the fundamental aspects of information systems, digital literacy, implementation of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in business, and more. All of which aim to empower individuals and prolong businesses in industry.  

Defining Information Systems 

 

Information systems are systematic, organized frameworks that offer a wide range of tools, procedures, and technologies that are used especially to gather, store, process, and distribute information within and between businesses.  

 

These systems are vital in converting unprocessed data into knowledge that can be used, acting as the basic framework for contemporary enterprises. Information systems are necessary to streamline operational procedures and enable well-informed decision-making.

Digital Literacy is a broad skillset that enables people to skilfully negotiate the complexities of the digital world. It includes both core skills which includes reading, writing, and communicationâ€”as well as specialized technological skills such as using computers, cell phones, and other e-tools. 

Enabling people to efficiently access, arrange, and distribute information in the digital sphere is the core goal of digital literacy. 

 

This skill set spans a spectrum of capabilities that include navigation proficiency, effective communication skills, information evaluation.

Examples include Google Workspace which is a suite of office productivity applications like Google Docs, Google Drive, Gmail etc, and MSOffice encompassing, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access.
